# Environmental Justice Data Pipeline (EJPipeline)

[![Python tests](https://github.com/willf/ejpipeline/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/willf/ejpipeline/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains the code for the Environmental Justice Data Pipeline (EJPipeline) project. The EJPipeline is a data processing pipeline collects data from various sources relevant to environmental justice and processes it to make it more accessible to researchers and the public. The pipeline is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new data sources and processing steps. We also aim to minimize the Python dependencies required to run the pipeline, so that it can be run on a wide variety of systems. Further, we aim to use previous open source work as much as possible, and to contribute back to the open source community.
